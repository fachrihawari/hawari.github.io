Everybody who start learning about programming will confused and have many question.may be the question as below :Where i can start ?What the language should I use ?how long ?What should I prepared ?My Suggestion1. Find your passionBefore you start, i will ask, do you like design or something like that ? if yes, you must try learn “web design” but if not may be you a logical man, you must learn something like “Algorithm of programming” first.2. Join to communityAfter you choose where is your passion, i suggest you to join to community like group facebook “PHP Indonesia” or “Laravel PHP Framework” and then try interactive learning like in Code.org, Codecademy, Code Politan. When you join on a community you can ask anything but must follow rule of the community.3.
